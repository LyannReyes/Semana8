		<h2>What's a Videogame?</h2>
		<p class="parraA">A video game is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word video in video game traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial.</p>

		<p class="parraB">You've probably heard videogames are stupid and maybe even bad for you. The debate as to whether video games are good or bad for us has been going since the days of Pong and Space Invaders.

	    Unfortunately most people have always assumed they were the cause of many mental and physical problems. Even if there was a lack of scientific evidence to prove it.Some say it is in our human nature to find something to blame when thereâ€™s an issue, and video games have always been an easy target.

	    But things have changed and now more professional studies are being conducted to find out the truth.Sounds ironic coming for a blog dedicated to videogames. But don't you worry, here we value everyone's opinions about our favorite games, even if they can get so far fetchedly stupid, like that videogames can be bad for you.</p>
